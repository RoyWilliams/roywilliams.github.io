<h2>Hollingum</h2>
This is some of the story of the Hollingum line, a line of successful people who 
joined with the Williams family in 1846.
<ul>
<li><b>Thomas Hollingum</b> (1736-1791) father of 
<li><b>Josiah Hollingum</b> (1767-1824) father of
<li><b>Thomas Hollingum</b> (1799-1854) father of
<li><b>Elizabeth Amelia Hollingum</b> (1823-1885) who married
<li><b>Henry Williams</b> (1821-1903) father of
<li><b>Alfred William Williams</b> (1856-1916) father of
<li><b>Leslie Arthur Williams</b> (1890-1961) father of
<li><b>Ivan James Drayson Williams</b> (1925-2001) our father and grandfather
</ul>


The first Thomas Hollingum married Rebecca Munchin of Rochester in 1760.

His occupation is listed as victualler -- or grocer.
<p>
The will of the first Thomas Hollingum 
<a href=1THollingum_will_1.png>(image)</a>
<a href=1THollingum_will_2.png>(image)</a>
lists him as owner of cottages on Northfleet Hill, which I assume are those
demolished in 1958 where the Veterans Hall is now -- see image Northfleet_cottages.

The will also leaves 100s of pounds to his two sons, William and Thomas, 
then there is a codicil where Josiah also gets £200, or £35,000 in today's money.
<p>

For the son, Josiah Hollingum, we have the marriage certificate to Elizabeth Dominy 
<a href=JHollingumDominy_marriage.png>(image)</a>
from 1793, after he inherited the money from his father.
<p>

In 1851 some of Josiah's children were living at the Pilot pub in Gravesend

including his daughter Elizabeth -- now married to Henry Williams -- as well as 
William and Thomas (children of Josiah, not of the first Thomas).
<p>

In 1853 Henry, son of a Trinity House Pilot, qualifies himself as Pilot

and thus enters a privileged guild of experts.
<p>

The younger Thomas Hollingum dies in 1854 and left a substantial will

He owned numbers 2,3,4,5,6 Upper Peacock Street, Gravesend and bequeathed
them to his children, one of them
"Elizabeth Amelia the wife of Henry Williams of Gravesend aforesaid waterman"

Here is a streetview picture of these properties today
