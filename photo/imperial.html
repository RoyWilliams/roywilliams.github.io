<b>Coding Form</b>, 
Back in the old days of computing, programs were written in CAPITAL 
LETTERS IN FORTRAN on coding forms like this one, then punched in using a
card punch. Sometimes the coding form was handed to a typing pool 
person, who would introduce many mistakes because to them it was all just 
gibberish.
