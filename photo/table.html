<b>Copper-top Dining Table</b>, 
Mahogany and Copper. I have always been annoyed at table surfaces that are 
delicate (Oh no don't put that hot dish on there!). Also most surfaces that 
are not delicate tend to be tacky-looking (Formica). So this one is 
1/16th inch copper sheet, very hardwearing. However, every time you put down
a drink, or any acid (eg lemon), there is a bright spot on the brown 
surface which fades with time. I like the idea of keeping a record of
everything that was eaten or drunk at the table.
