<b>Job Control Card</b>, 
This punch card would be placed at the beginning of a deck of cards
to tell the card reader how to execute the program contained in the rest of the
deck. This one controls the PUFFT system (Purdue University Fast Fortran
Translator), and was ingested by the IBM 7094 -- the main computer
for Imperial College, London. The Pentium PC on my desk is 27 times faster.
