<b>Oscillating Tables</b>, (left) Birch and (right) Cherry.
The two intersection tetrahedra are held by a strong central tension 
line, with siz sprung lines at the outside to stabilize. There are five 
vibrational modes, two high and two low frequency, where the top and the bottom
move respectively, together with a torsional mode of middle frequency. The 
tetrahedra can be constructed with a cube at each corner.
