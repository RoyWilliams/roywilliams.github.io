<b>Spaghetti Junction</b>
Birmingham, England, 1976.
This is an urban intersection of two major motorways, with roads, 
a railway track and a canal intersecting at the same place. There
was (is?) a childrens playground at the lowest level, and
I wonder what the lead levels were. I spent Jan-August 1976 very close to here.
