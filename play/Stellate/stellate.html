<h1>The <i>Stellate</i> Program</h1>
<h3>Java3D for Fun and Pleasure</h3>

To run the Stellate program, you will need three things:
<UL>
<LI> An installation of Java 1.2 Runtime Environment, or the software 
development kit which is a superset. You can get this for Solaris, Windows
and Linux
from <a href=http://java.sun.com/jdk/>http://java.sun.com/jdk/</a>

<LI> An installation of Java3D. You can get this for Windows and Solaris from
<a href=http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/download.html>
http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/download.html</a>. For some strange
reason, it is important that the Java3D be installed in the same place as the 
Java 1.2 (the installation will suggest this place).

<LI> The code for the Stellate program, available from here as either 
<a href=Stellate.jar>Stellate.jar</a> or
<a href=Stellate.zip>Stellate.zip</a>.
Unpack the files, and type the command <tt>java Stellate</tt> in the directory 
that you unpacked. If your path is not set up, you may need to be more explicit, for example <tt>d:\jdk1.2.2\bin\java Stellate</tt>
</UL>
