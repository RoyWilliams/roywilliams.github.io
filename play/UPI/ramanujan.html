<title>Ramanujan Formulae for Pi</title> 
<h1>Ramanujan Formulae for Pi</h1>

Perhaps this man takes the title for the most mystical of mathematicians:
one who would "simply know" that a complex result in number theory is
true, and then be able to prove it. An excellent
<a href=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Ramanujan.html>short biography</a> of Ramanujan is available from St Andrews University
in Scotland.
<p>
There are several formulae for pi (actually the reciprocal of pi) created
by Ramanujan which converge extremely quickly. One of these was used by
the Chudnovsky brothers, as reported in the "New Yorker" in 1993 or 
thereabouts, to compute two billion digits from surplus computing equipment
hacked together in their apartment in Manhattan.
<p>
One of the fomulae is this one:<br>

which produces eight more decimal palces with each term. Incidentally,
the large integers are in an arithmetic progression.
