<title>The Most Useless Pi Algorithm</title> 
<center><h1>The Most Useless Pi Algorithm</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2></center>
There are many algorithms for computing pi, ranging from the fiercely
efficient <a href=ramanujan.html>Ramanujan formulae</a> 
that can become thirty orders of magnitude more
accurate with each additional term in the expansion, to the familiar
but plodding result from the power-series expansion of arctan(1), for which
more detail is <a href=../upi/pi.formulas.html>here</a>.
<p>
This page is concerned not with finding a <i>more</i> efficient way to compute
pi, since one would need to be extremely intelligent to do better than
all the clever mathematicans who have worked on it.

<center><h2>Uselessness:</h2>
<h3>A Cost-Benefit Analysis</h3></center>
<b>Enough with efficiency!</b> This page describes a candidate for
the <b>most useless</b> way of computing pi. Let us define this concept
more closely with a cost-benefit analysis: I shall define uselessness in
terms of <i>high cost</i>, both computational and intellectual, and in
terms of <i>zero or negative benefit</i>. The algorithm discussed below,
you may be assured, provides a highly negative benefit and high initial cost. 
<p>
<b><i>
The idea is to take a million or so digits of pi that have been computed by
somebody else, and use these to extract an extremely inaccurate
approximation to pi.
</i></b>
<p>
We could of course take the million digits and strip off 999,999 of them, but 
we can also do better, by adding considerable intellectual and computational
cost to arrive at the approximation.

<center><h2>The Algorithm</h2></center>
The algorithm is based on the following two ideas:
<UL>
<LI>The probability of two large random integers being coprime (having no 
common factor) is <img src=6opisq.gif>. <a href=coprime.html>A proof of this</a>,
using the magnificent Riemann zeta function, is lots of fun.
<LI>The digits of pi form a random sequence. I have no proof of this, and neither
does anyone else, because it is patently not true: the digits of pi are very
definite and well-defined, not random. Perhaps a better statement
would be that the digit sequence passes all known tests for randomness.
</UL>

The algorithm is then this: 
<blockquote>
Take N digits of the decimal expansion of pi to
serve as a pool of random digits. From these take samples of pairs of n-digit
numbers. Count the number of coprime pairs, and after K samples derive an 
estimate of the probability of a pair being coprime, which is thus an estimate
for <img src=6opisq.gif>, and hence we can estimate pi itself.
</blockquote>

If N, n and K are all infinite (ha ha) then the result for pi is exact, and the
trick in running this algorithm practially is in choosing these numbers a
ppropriately. I used the value of pi from 
<ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/etext/gutenberg/etext93/pimil10.txt>
Project Gutenberg, with N=1250000 digits. The way to tell if two numbers are
coprime is by the <a href=euler.html>Euler method</a>.
I used successive sequences of
6-digit numbers until they ran out, so that the first few samples are:
<pre>
314159 265358 coprime
979323 846264 not coprime (common factor is 3)
338327 950288 coprime
419716 939937 coprime
510582  97494 not coprime (common factor is 6)
459230 781640 not coprime (common factor is 10)
628620 899862 not coprime (common factor is 6)
</pre>
<p>
The final result is that of the 104000 pairs of random 6-digit numbers, 
63022 of them were coprime, so that we (uselessly) conclude that pi
is approximately sqrt(6*104000/63022), which is:
<center><h2>pi = 3.146634</h2></center>
which is really pretty useless I think, considering that the only thing we 
started with was a value of pi accurate to over a million decimal places.

I would like to thank Robert A. J. Matthews of the 
<a http://www.aston.ac.uk/home.html>University of Aston</a> in England, 
who had the idea of using coprimality of random integers
to compute pi. See "Nature", vol 374, page 681, April 20, 1995.
