<title>The Euler algorithm for common factor</title>
<h1>The Euler algorithm for common factor</h1>
To find the common factor of two numbers m and n we need to be able
to evaluate remainders, or modular arithmetic.
<p>
We take our pair of integers, and generate a new pair, and from the new
pair generate another, and so on until one member of the pair is zero.
If the input numbers are m(1) and n(1) with m(1) > n(1), the algorithm is:
<pre>
	m(i+1) = n(i)
	n(i+1) = m(i) mod n(i)
</pre>
After a few iterations, one of the n becomes zero, and the common factor
that we seek is the corresponding m. If this common factor is 1, then the
original numbers were coprime.
<p>
For example, to discover the common factor of 102 and 54 we generate this 
sequence:
<pre>
102 54
54 48 
48 6
6 0
</pre>
so that the common factor is 6.
