<title>Probability of two numbers being Coprime</title>
<h1>Probability of two numbers being Coprime</h1>

Let us begin by observing that the probability of a large number being divisible
by a prime p is 1/p. We specify "large" number to make sure it is bigger than p.
The probability that two independently chosen large numbers are both divisible
by p is then 1/p^2.
<p>
If the two numbers are coprime, then for each prime p, p does not divide both
numbers. If we assume that being divisible by one prime is independent of
being divisible by another, then the probability of the numbers being coprime
is<br> <img src=zeta2.gif>.<p>
Let us define a generalization of the reciprocal of this as the <i>Riemann zeta 
function:</i><br>
<img src=zeta.gif><br>
where the product is over all primes less than our numbers. Assuming the numbers
are large, and letting the product be over all primes, we can define this 
as the zeta function. It turns out that the zeta function can also be written
as a sum:

<p>
This relationship can be proved by expanding each term in the product
as a power series. When the power series are multiplied together, we use
the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, that each integer is expressible
as a product of powers of primes, and each product of powers of primes 
represnts just one integer. This product formula for the zeta function provides
a bridge from the properties of certain integers (prime numbers), to a 
function that depends on a real number (actually a complex number), which 
may be examined with the powerful tools of calculus and analytic function theory.
<p>
The value of the zeta function at s=2 is then the reciprocal of the probability
that we seek. 
Taking a function like this:<br>
<img src=quad.gif> <br>
and expanding it as a Fourier series can provide a value for zeta(2). 
The functionis piecewise quadratic but also periodic, and the value of the
Fourier series at the cusp shows that zeta(2) is <img src=pi26.gif>, so that
the reciprocal of this is the probability of two large numbers being coprime.
