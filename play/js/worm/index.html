<h2>Worm Life</h2>
<script src="/play/worm/processing.js"></script>
You are the worm with the blue head, moving between the feeding stations, 
gaining an extra segment each time. The pink chasers attack your tail, 
zipping each time they get you. You can kill them by moving your blue head
over their heads, and you zip when you get one. Your score is the maximum number of segments you had in the game.
