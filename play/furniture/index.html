<b>Three Nightstands</b>,
American and Peruvian walnut, quilted maple. Having fun with the new dovetail jig.

<hr>
<img src=/photo/PB060013-s.jpg><br>
<b>Pendulum Cradle</b>,
Curly cherry. Getting ready for a new arrival! There are artifical jewels
embedded in the inside -- diamond, ruby, and spinel.

<hr>
<img src=/photo/Picture001.jpg><br>
<b>Fantasy Hall Chair</b>,
Mahogany. This was an excuse to buy a new router, and a fun
time carving the back and the curlicues.

<hr>
<img src=/photo/chair1-s.jpg>
<img src=/photo/chair2-s.jpg><br>
<b>Eight dining chairs</b>, 
Curly cherry, silver inlay, jade, carnelian, black leather seats. 
The largest project I have done, the best part was going to Hollywood
to buy a "hide", meaning the leather covering an entire steer.

<b>Sideboard</b>,
Curly cherry with period brass hardware. There are secret compartments inside 
and I will never tell how to get to them or what is stored there.

<b>Two mission armchairs, ottomans, and sofa</b>,
Red oak. The suite has cutouts of the capital letters "R" and "J" in the
central vertical slats of the sides. The chairs have curved arms.

<img src=/photo/P2010003.jpg><br>
<b>Mission Bed</b>,
Curly cherry. This means Mission style furniture, not missionary position.
The horizontal rail at the foot is pretty good for finding
your way back to bed after insomniac sessions with the internet.

<b>Balustrade and picnic table</b>,
California redwood. When we moved to the new house, I was able to start 
up my shop again after the hiatus of rental property. The fancy fence was
an excuse to buy a table saw and tenoning jig.

<a href=/photo/chaise3.jpg><img src=/photo/chaise3-s.jpg></a><br>
<b>Pope's Chair</b>, 
Oak, inscribed <i>Ceci n'est pas une chaise</i> (this is not a chair).
The theory is that the inscription converts the chair to an art object, 
which is why it is not a chair (because it is an art object).
I saw the design in the Vatican Museum: it is the kind of chair that 
the guards sit on.

<b>Folding Throne</b>, Cherry, leather, piano hinges.
This chair has a triangular plan, and can be folded for easy storage.

<b>Oscillating Tables</b>, (left) Birch and (right) Cherry.
The two intersecting tetrahedra are held by a strong central tension 
line, with six sprung lines at the outside to stabilize. There are five 
vibrational modes, two high and two low frequency, where the top and the bottom
move respectively, together with a torsional mode of middle frequency. The 
tetrahedra can be constructed with a cube at each corner.

<b>Magazine Rack</b>, Maple.
This based on a Stickley design, and it is held together with a single wedge at the top, a double wedge at the bottom.

<td> <a href=/photo/FURN3A.JPG><img src=/photo/FURN3A-S.JPG></a> </td> <td> 
<b>Coffee Table</b>, Cherry and walnut.
The top is bookmatched crotch cherry, the horizontal and vertical "buffers"
are crotch walnut. The crotch part of a tree is where a branch meets the main
trunk; it is very strong, with pronounced optical properties.
</td></tr>

<td> <a href=/photo/buffer2.jpg><img src=/photo/buffer2-s.jpg></a> </td> <td> 
<b>Coffee Table</b>, Birch and walnut.
Another version of the same coffee table: the top is bookmatched birch, 
the horizontal and vertical "buffers" are black-stained walnut.

<table> <tr>

<b>Bookcase</b>, maple-faced plywood
The case is wider at the bottom, as well as being able to accomodate 
taller books. The diagonals stabilize the structure. The original
idea came from peeking in the window of an architect's office in
Amsterdam.<br>

taller books. The diagonals stabilize the structure. The original

<b>Frame and Paper</b>, 
Birds-eye maple and Japanese hand-blocked paper,
Brought by a friend from Japan, this paper seemed so perfect and beautiful
that it should have a frame made from it from this most beautiful of woods.

<b>Copper-top Dining Table</b>, 
Mahogany and Copper. I have always been annoyed at table surfaces that are 
delicate (Oh no don't put that hot dish on there!). Also most surfaces that 
are not delicate tend to be tacky-looking (Formica). So this one is 
1/16th inch copper sheet, very hardwearing. However, every time you put down
a drink, or any acid (eg lemon), there is a bright spot on the brown 
surface which fades with time. I like the idea of keeping a record of
everything that was eaten or drunk at the table.

<table> <tr>
<td> <a href=/photo/CLOCK.JPG><img src=/photo/CLOCK-S.JPG></a> </td> <td> 

<b>Ornament</b>, Padauk wood, blue and green stained glass.
The glass is held together with copper tape. This was originally a clock ,
but I think it is better without the hands and the bulky box behind.
