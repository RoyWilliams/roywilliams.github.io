In this quiet, reflective, inward-looking painting, 
a table and curtain separate us from the well-dressed young woman reading
a letter. The large green curtain may be intended as part of the
scene, or it may be a <i>trompe d'oeil</i> to look like the painting has a
physical curtain to cover it, as was popular in Dutch households at the time.
<p>
She is enclosed also by the horizontality of the curtain rail and the
deep shadow at the top of the picture. This enclosure and separation
provide intimacy: she is alone in an unguarded moment, unviolated by
the intrusion of the viewer.
<p>
On the table is a dish of apples and peaches, reminding us 
of Eve's Fall. The window is open, representing her desire to escape
her duties as a housewife. There is a red curtain pulled back from the
window: red is the color of love. She reads with great attention -- 
perhaps the letter is from her illicit lover.
<p>
The woman's hair and sleeve show for the first time Vermeer's use of
brilliant blobs of impasto paint to render higlights.
