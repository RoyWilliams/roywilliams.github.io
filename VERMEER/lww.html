A melancholy, shadowed picture, the only one of Vermeer showing classical
mythology, with this theme from Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>.
Diana, with the crescent moon on her head, is considered 
the embodiment of chastity, and the bathing goddess
scene is thought to show this virgin purity and morality. Two companions
wash Diana's feet while another looks on, and a fourth has her back to us,
looking into the distance. 
<p>
In the mythology, after the moment depicted here, a prince out hunting, 
Actaeon, stumbles upon the naked Diana. He is turned into a stag and
<b>devoured by dogs</b>; the thistle and dog at lower left represent the 
impending arrival and devouring.
<p>
Washing of feet provides a link with the washing of Christ's feet; another 
link may be with the washing of Bathsheba's feet (Samuel 2:11), painted 
contemporaneously by Rembrandt.
Titian painted this scene a century earlier, with everyone naked and the
crime of Actaeon rather more believable than Vermeer's prudish version.
The figures are not painted with the fluid skill of Vermeer's mature
period, and there are residual attribution questions about this painting.
