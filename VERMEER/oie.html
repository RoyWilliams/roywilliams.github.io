When Vermeer married Catherina Bolnes in 1653, he converted to
Catholicism, and even named one of his sons Ignatius, after the
founder of the Jesuit movement. This grisly painting, with its overt themes,
may have been commissioned by the Jesuits.
<p>
The subject is St Praxedis, daughter of Pudens, and sister of St Pudentia,
seen at right. St. Praxedis was 
elevated for her services to the dead bodies of Martyrs, and here
she is seen cleaning blood from the decapitated corpse behind her. Also
in her hands, (rather strained composition here) is a crucifix, symbolizing
the mingling of the martyr's blood with that of Christ.
<p>
This painting is derivative of one by the Florentine, Ficherelli, and has
only recently been firmly attributed to Vermeer. Such paintings were
very saleable at the time, and Vermeer was 23, recently married, and
the family begun. 
<p>
The composition is
not reminiscent of Vermeer; no sense of enclosure, no barriers, no
intricate perspective. The thoughtful face of the Saint is
perhaps the most memorable feature of this painting: notice its similarity
to the face in <a href=huh.html>The Girl Asleep</a>.
