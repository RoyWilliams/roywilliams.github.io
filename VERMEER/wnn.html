A man swathed in darkness holds a pitcher of wine, while watching 
an elegantly dressed woman drink. She is wearing a silk dress with gold
edging, and her face is partially hidden by her headscarf and by the
glass itself, almost like a mask. The two have been playing music, a theme
often associated with love. This is a subdued, careful painting of elegant 
people in an elegant room with a gold-framed landscape on the wall.
<p>
The room is in partial darkness because of curtains and
shutters, and the most brightly illuminated parts of the painting is
the carefully rendered window. In composition, it seems similar to
the works of Vermeer's contemporary, Pieter de Hooch.
<p>
The window shows the arms of Jannetje Vogel, who married Vermeer's neighbor,
Moses Nederveen. Surrounding the arms is the figure of a woman holding
a horse's bridle in one hand, an image of temperance. The window is 
identical to that in <a href=ooi.html>The Girl with the Wineglass</a>,
another exhortation of Temperance. According to Jacob Cats, a contemporary
writer, women should be forbidden drink altogether, as alcohol was the first
step towards whoring.
<p>
So it seems that a seduction is taking place, with wine as the lubricant.
Could it be that the man is Vermeer, at least symbolically, and the woman
is Jannetje, wife of his neighbor?
