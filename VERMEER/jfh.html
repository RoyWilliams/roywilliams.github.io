This large, biblical, dark work seems like a different artist altogether
from the later works of serene interiors, but the signature on Mary's
stool is quite definitive. Perhaps the painting was commissioned. 
<p>
The figures form a triangle, with Christ pointing to Mary, but looking
at Martha. The background is merely sketched, strengthening the
closeness of the group. Christ was invited home for a meal by Martha,
and she is preparing the food while Mary is chatting with Christ and
Martha is aggrieved; He tells her <i>"Mary hath chosen that good part,
which shall not be taken away from her"</i> (Luke 10:41). This is often
interpreted as a justification of the contemplative life.
