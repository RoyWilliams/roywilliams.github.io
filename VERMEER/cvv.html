In this exquisite painting, Vermeer has achieved beauty in many
dimensions: <b>Light, Color, Composition and Mood</b>. There is symbolism
in the painting if you care to find it, but it is not the heavy-handed
shopping-list of familiar tokens that we expect from some of his 
contemporaries.
<p>
The light from the window is rendered in several ways. The cloudy 
sky is reflected in the window-glass. The ochre wall
shows subtle radiosity effects; the blue of the sky can be seen reflected
from it near the window. Following up edge of the woman's dress, the wall
color changes from red-brown to blue-white, an effect that also accentuates 
the contour of her hip. The light on the starched, white headdress is
very delicate, with blue, yellow, transparency, crinkles, folds, corners.
There is a suggestion that as the blue of the sky is re-radiated from
the headdress, so the woman's presence brings the sky into the room.
The black and yellow dress is painted with bright highlights of paint
and also hints of blue that give a subtle sheen to the material.
The reflections on the pitcher and dish are also painted with exquisite care,
with the red oriental rug on the table reproduced on the underside of the 
dish, and a more diffuse red stripe on the side of the pitcher.
<p>
Compositionally, the woman acts as a bridge from the window frame
to the table, with a balance from the map at the top right. The eye
moves easily between these three places on the canvas: window, woman, table,
the curves of her figure integrating the rectangles.
Note how the contour of the pitcher continues smoothly up the woman's
sleeve. The negative spaces of the composition are the counterpoint; 
consider for a moment the three major wall-areas and how they balance the
three areas of positive space. Perhaps in Vermeer we can see the precursor
of that other Dutch master of composition, Piet Mondrian.
<p>
The woman's tranquil mood pervades the scene, quiet and pensive, but with 
the momentary action of opening the window to enliven the scene.  On the
table is a jewel box with the blue ribbons spilling out, and behind is
a blue dress. She is perhaps doing her wifely duties, but thinking of the
outside world -- the window and map -- and thinking of dressing up
for a night on the town.
