A young woman tunes her lute by a window, looking out at something happening
in the street. She is elegantly dressed in the
ermine-trimmed yellow jacket that appears many Vermeers. Because 
she is seated low and the viewpoint is also low, the sense of barrier provided
by the table and erupting lion-finialled chair is especially strong.
On the floor, but no longer visible due to poor condition, there is
more music and a violin, perhaps in expectation of a partner's arrival.
<p>
The map of Europe behind the woman was published by Jodicus Hondius in
1613, reprinted by Joan Blaeu in 1659.

Unfortunately, this painting is in poor condition, with much of the
subtle interplay of color no longer visible.
