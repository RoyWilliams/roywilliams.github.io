A group of three play music together, voice, lute and harpsichord, and
apparently all is innocent. There are two pastoral scenes, one painted
on the lid of the harpsichord, one on wall; the latter includes a dead
tree, a hint that all is not as perfect as we might assume.
While the scene is serene and still, there is movement from the upraised
hand of the singer beating time. The painting seems quite similar
to <a href=ych.html>The Music Lesson</a>, even to the black and white
floor tiles and the rich red carpet draped over a table to provide a
foreground. 
<p>
But the painting at the upper right is not another pastoral
scene, it is <a href=bab.jpg>Dirck van Baburen's The Procuress</a>.
Are we to think that Vermeer, who controls every square millimeter of
his canvases, did not realize the message? Or are we to think that the
<b>lute-player is selling the sexual services of singer or harsichordist? </b>
<p>
Vermeer painted his own <a href=udn.html>Procuress</a>, and used the
Baburen picture in his <a href=nbe.html>Lady Seated at the Virginals</a>.
It is presumed that the Baburen picture hung in Vermeer's house, for it 
is mentioned in the inventory of his mother-in-law's house from 1641: 
<i>A painting wherein a procuress points to the hand</i>. It is now in 
the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.
<p>
Vermeer's <i>The Concert</a> was one of eleven paintings stolen 
from the Isabella Stuart Gardner Museum, Boston, on March 18, 1990, 
and is not yet recovered.
