This portrait of a woman seems to be slightly vacant, with an air of
purity. The pose of the face is similar to that in
<a href=xce.html>The Girl with a Pearl Earring</a>, but there is less
ambiguity and less color. The face is painted with Vermeer's subtlety
and delicacy, the composition enhanced by the opposite diagonals of her
headpiece down and right, with her collar making the other diagonal. 
The dress and the arm seem similar to 
<a href=shh.html>The Girl in the Red Hat</a>; they are painted with 
considerable impressionistic softness, the arm and hand even more so,
perhaps even clumsy.
<p>
It is thought that this painting may be a portrait of Vermeer's eldest
daughter, Maria.
