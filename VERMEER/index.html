<H1>Paintings of Vermeer</H1>
Johannes Vermeer created luscious canvases of limited scope: generally women
and men in seventeenth-century rooms, but also occasional outdoor scenes, 
allegory and religious themes. The fascination lies with the intricate
combination of light, color, proportion and scale that enhances the moods
and reality of the subjects.<p>
Vermeer (1632-1675) lived all his life in 
<a href=http://www.xxlink.nl/cities/delft>Delft</a>. Much of his 
<a href=history.html>history</a> is obscure.

Tom van Halteran has made <a href=http://www.about-vermeer-art.com>
a really excellent and comprehensive site</a> about all aspects of 
the painter. Highly recommended!

<LI>
A <a href=http://www.caareviews.org/reviews/gaskell.html>book review of 
<i><b>Vermeer Studies</b></i></a>, edited by Ivan Gaskell 
and Michiel Jonker. This long-awaited volume contains a large selection of 
the papers that were delivered at a symposia in Washington, D.C., in 1995 
and The Hague in 1996 in connection with the Vermeer exhibition held at 
the National Gallery of Art</A> and  the Mauritshuis respectively.

Jonathan Janson has made some <a href=http://www.geocities.com/Paris/Louvre/8952/index.html>splendid paintings</a> in the style of Vermeer.
<p>
<LI> There is an 
<a href=http://www.xs4all.nl/~kalden>excellent and detailed description</a>
of the <a href=hcc.html>View of Delft</a> by Kees en Brenda Kaldenbach, 
with explanations of the geography,
architecture, and perspective, true and false.
<p>
<LI> The <b>True Falsies</b> company in Germany makes a postcard of
a modern parody of Vermeer, called <a href=falsies.html>The Girl on
the Phone with a Tape Measure</a>.
<p>
<LI> Philip Steadman from the Open University in the UK have produced
<a href=http://www-tech.open.ac.uk/old-design/vermeer.html>
an excellent paper on the Camera Obscura</a>, showing from careful
perspective analysis that it was almost certainly used.
<p>
<LI> There is a <a href=http://sgwww.epfl.ch/BERGER/Vermeer/>
fine scholarly Vermeer page</a> (in French) written by René Berger and
his colleagues at EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland.

<LI> <a href=http://www.maxule.com/>Max Ule</a> from New York 
has an excellent online collection of 
<a href=http://www.maxule.com/photos/vermeer>bootleg photographs
of the 1996 exhibition at the Mauritshuis</a>, which he took with a camera
hidden under a cowboy hat. There is also a picture of a 
<a href=http://www.maxule.com/photos/vermeer/vermeerh.jpg>"Girl in the Red
Hat Patisserie"</a>, but how can one in conscience eat such a thing?
