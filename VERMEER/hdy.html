A dark, large soldier in a large hat seems almost too large as he
faces the smiling, innocent girl, who is bathed in light and nervously
holding the wine-glass in front of her. Contrast between the figures
is established by <b>scale, color, mood and attitude</b>. 
<p>
The figures are very close to
the picture plane, like a wide-angle lens, emphasizing the differences
in size and power between the figures. The vanishing point is midway
between the two heads, emphasizing their bond. This picture may have been
painted with a <i>Camera Obscura</i>, a newly invented optical device
for projecting a scene onto a flat surface.

<p>
The map is by Balthasar van Berckenrode, from 1620. North is to the left,
and the lake is visible which is now Amsterdam Airport. Cartography was
becoming popular in mid-17th century Holland, and the expensive luxury
of a map on the wall indicated education. The same map is also 
visible in <a href=mwp.html>The Love Letter</a>.
