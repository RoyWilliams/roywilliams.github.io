This late Vermeer is a beautiful, glowing image of a girl playing the guitar.
It is painted
with planes of color rather than with outline; the brushwork is free and
soft, giving tha painting a shimmering delicacy. There is an abstract
pattern formed by the shape of her hair ringlets.
<p>
The girl is placed asymmetrically, far to the left, and her arm is cut
off by the edge of the painting. Behind her is a landscape, also left of
center, and she looks left to a point outside the painting. At the right
is shadow, a curtained window, and some books. Presumably
Vermeer has experimented by purposely upsetting the careful compositional
balance evident in his earlier paintings.
<p>
A month after Vermeer's death, in January 1676, this and another painting
were used to settle a debt of 617 guilders with Hendrick van Buyten,
the master baker of Delft. In 1974, the painting was stolen from Kenwood
House by supporters of the IRA, and found in a churchyard ten weeks later.
