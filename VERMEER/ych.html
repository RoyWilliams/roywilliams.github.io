This famous painting was executed by Vermeer at the height of his powers.
The formal, almost abstract, composition is presented as patterns
of color and shape, but at the same time the ambiguity of the human
relationship draws us in. The perfectly rendered window provides a
frame at the left, and the spare horizontality of the roof-beams frames
the picture at the top. The diagonal pattern of marble floor-tiles
draws our eye into the picture and the pattern of rectangles on the back
wall would be spoiled if any one of them were moved; in this
geometric composition, one can imagine
a preview of another great Dutch artist, Piet Mondrian.
<p>
The woman playing the clavecin
has her back to us, so that we see composition and human 
relationship rather than her face. But she is reflected in the mirror
above her. The real and reflected heads are not consistent: in the mirror
she seems to be turning towards the man. It has been suggested that the
mirror shows part of the artist's easel, drawing us into the picture
in a very explicit way.
<p>
As with <a href=mee.html>Girl Interrupted at her Music</a>, it is not clear
if the man is a teacher or a lover. Behind the woman
is a bass viol, which perhaps the man has been playing in duet.
On the clavecin, there is an inscription, <i>Musica Letitiae Comes Medicina 
Dolorum</i>, [Music is the Companion of Joy, the Medicine of Sorrow].
At lower right is a richly decorated oriental carpet, anchoring the eye 
and providing a separation between viewer and  subjects, on it is 
the familar, prominent white pitcher, which may contain wine; are we to 
conclude that the couple are about to descend into sin, lubricated by 
demon drink?

John R. Wallace, Michael F. Cohen, and Donald P. Greenberg of Cornell.
