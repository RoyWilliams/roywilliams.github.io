A shy, nervous young woman is well-dressed in exquisitely rendered
red silk with gold brocade. She looks to the viewer with a smiling, unsure
expression, while a smooth, confident gentleman encourages her to drink.
<p>
The window shows the arms of Jannetje Vogel, who married Vermeer's neighbor,
Moses Nederveen. Surrounding the arms is the figure of a woman holding
a horse's bridle in one hand, an image of temperance. The window is 
identical to that in <a href=wnn.html>The Glass of Wine</a>,
another exhortation of Temperance.
<p>
The painting on the back wall is of a dignified man in a lace collar, 
presumably the master of the house, looking down on his wife 
hesitantly beginning an affair.
A shodowy figure seated at the back is ambiguous: perhaps he is the match
and the man in the center is the matchmaker, or perhaps he is a 
chaperone who has abrogated his duty.
<p>
This painting has been on public display since 1754, due to the generosity
of the Duke of Braunschweig;
he gallery is the oldest public gallery in Germany.
