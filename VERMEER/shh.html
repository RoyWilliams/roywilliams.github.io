Here is one of the most famous Vermeers: a beautiful young woman,
sensual, expectant, emotionally engaging, to be compared with the 
equally delicious <a href=xce.html>Girl with a Pearl Earring</a>.
The light falls from above, shading the girl's eyes, so that only her cheek
and nose are illuminated. This has the same effect as a veil, increasing
our curiosity by mystery.
<p>
Part of the appeal of the painting stems from the bizarre color palette,
with red and green on the face, purple under the red hat, turquoise in
the eyes, and yellow highlights on the folds of the blue robe. This painting
is on a wood panel, making the painting smoother and more lustrous than
the absorptive canvas of Vermeer's other paintings.

In the background is a tapestry, and
in the foreground is a chair topped with lion heads. This chair can be seen
in seven other Vermeer's -- see for example
<a href=mee.html>Girl Interrupted at her Music</a> or
<a href=wbt.html>A Lady Writing a Letter</a>, but in all of those the lion
head faces the other way. Here, Vermeer has rotated the lion heads to allow
a more natural placement of the girl's arm. Notice also the diffuse,
circular spots on the highlights of the lion-head, which are characteristic
of the look of a camera with insufficient depth of field, and are taken
as evidence that Vermeer knew of the <i>Camera Obscura</i>, a seventeenth
century precursor of photography.
